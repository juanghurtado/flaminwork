# Flaminwork #

This is just a tiny front-end framework for lazy developers. HTML5, CSS and Javascript goodness for everybody!

## Changelog ##

* **v0.1-beta (March 22, 2011)**: First version. Basic funcionality (Grid system, reset and default styles, minor Javascript goodiesâ€¦)

## How to use it? ##

Just [download the latest copy of Flaminwork](https://github.com/juanghurtado/flaminwork/zipball/master), unzip it into a <code>flaminwork</code> folder in your project and link the files in your <code>HEAD</code> element (jQuery is required, but not included, so it's linked from Google CDN. You can use your local copy instead):

	<!-- Styles -->
	<link href="flaminwork/flaminwork.css" rel="stylesheet" />

	<!-- Scripts -->
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="../flaminwork/flaminwork.js"></script>
	
## Demo ##

You can watch what Flaminwork does by [looking at the live demo](http://flaminwork.com/demo/), or sneaking around the files inside <code>samples</code> folder on the [zip file](https://github.com/juanghurtado/flaminwork/zipball/master).
